# MSAL Interactive Token Acquirer

This is a library to acquire Microsoft OAuth2 access token **interactively**.

## Overview

This library supports **interactive** authentication.  
If you need a library for non-interactive authentication, you can use [MSAL for python](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python), which supports many authentication flows.

## How to use

You can acquire Microsoft OAuth2 access token interactively as follows:

```python
from msal_interactive_token_acquirer import MsalInteractiveTokenAcquirer

tenant = "common"
client_id = "5d2a0ea0-a46a-4626-835e-04e13f75fed0"
scopes = ["User.Read"]
msal = MsalInteractiveTokenAcquirer(tenant, client_id, scopes)
msal.acquire_token_interactively()  # (*1)
msal.access_token()
# => This returns Bearer token.
```

This shows the following window at `(*1)`.

You can save and load `MsalInteractiveTokenAcquirer` as follows:

```python
from msal_interactive_token_acquirer import MsalInteractiveTokenAcquirer
import pickle

# ...snip...

# msal is an instance of MsalInteractiveTokenAcquirer.
with open("msal.pickle", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(msal, f)

# ...snip...

with open("msal.pickle", "rb") as f:
    msal = pickle.load(f)
msal.access_token()
# => This returns Bearer token.
```
